This is a complete instruction to replace the VFD of a KEITHLEY 2000 with a color TFT display.
For details see the Conversion Guide.
The main difference compared to the OLED version is that very little mechanical work is required, and the TFT color display with a higher resolution of 320x960 pixels is available for around $25 including the LT7600 board, which is significantly cheaper than the OLED panel.
The expanded display of the device state and the optimized display of the measurement results by grouping numbers in threes significantly improves readability by chunking digits, aligning with how we name numbers (thousands, millions), and reducing cognitive load, making large numbers easier to scan.
